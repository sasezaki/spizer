/**
 * Spizer queue class - a container for the queue of URLs to be crawled by the
 * engine  
 * 
 * The queue class contains the list of pending targets to crawl - and also 
 * serves then in particular order to the engine upon request. URLs can be 
 * appended to the queue transparently, and will be served to the engine in one
 * of two orders: FIFO (default) or LIFO, depending on how the queue object was
 * set up.  
 * 
 * FIFO will serve the longest pending URL first - this will result in a flat
 * crawling patten, going deep in the tree only after the "root" elements are 
 * crawled. 
 * 
 * LIFO crawling will serve the newest pending URL first - the result is a 
 * deep crawling pattern, in which the engine will finish crawling all the 
 * dependencies of one document before moving to the next one.
 * 
 * The queue object implements the SPL Countable interface, allowing it to be 
 * passed to the count() function - this will return the number of pending URLs 
 *
